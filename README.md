## Little Summary
As for my skills with HTML & CSS I thought that it would be much harder for me to create this website and accomplish this challange.
However, to my surprise it only took me a day and a half, and was a nice wee challange that I really enjoyed.

I didn't expect I could make a fully responsive website with so little coding in css, it's my new record!
In the past I used to use a ton of position:relatives, which wasn't very professional.

In overall, I did not have any issues, the challange wasn't too difficult, and was really nice.

## Some information
As specified in the challange, I only used HTML & CSS.
The HTML file was slightly modified, but most of the magic happens in CSS.

**Many Thanks!** ðŸš€
